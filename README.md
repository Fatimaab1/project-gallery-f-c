# project-gallery-f-c

In this project, I created a gallery to showcase the projects that I have been working on. The gallery presents my projects in an organised and visually appealing way. 

&nbsp;

**PLANNING:**

When planning this project, I used the following information:

- I identified the purpose of the project which allowed me to determine the most effective way to present my work visually and create a layout that best showcases my projects

- I brainstormed various features that could enhance the functionality and interactivity of the project gallery, whilst also trying to meet the set requirements.

**BUILDING:**

To develop this project, I utilised the project plan I had created as a guide. This plan helped me stay organised and focused on the key objectives of the project.


- I began by using flexbox to create the card features and ensuring that the layout and positioning were accurate.

- After completing the card features, I proceeded to add the required information to each card . This involved adding an image of the project to each card, as well as a brief description that explained the project's purpose 

- As per the project requirements, I incorporated a 'Read More' button that would reveal additional text when clicked and hide it when clicked again. To achieve this functionality, I utilised JavaScript. The code defined a maximum number of characters to display and hide any additional text beyond that limit. 

- The 'Read More' button was implemented using a function that revealed the full content for the corresponding element and changed the button text to 'Read Less'.

- After completing the functionality section, I moved on to styling. For the design, I aimed for a simple but playful aesthetic that would effectively showcase the projects. Overall, I focused on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

**DEBUGGING:**

- For this project I encountered a javascript error. while implementing the 'Read More' button functionality, the code only worked on the first card. To troubleshoot this issue, I used developer tools and Google to identify the root cause. Despite my efforts, I was unable to resolve the error, so I turned to W3Schools to explore alternative approaches. Through a process of trial and error, I eventually managed to get the code working by experimenting with different methods and playing with the code until it worked as intended.
