                <h2>Hobby Project</h2>
                <p class="content"> For this coding project, I created a simple web page using HTML, CSS, and JS that
                    showcases my passion for baking. The page not only includes information about some of my favourite
                    baking interests, but also features one of my favourite cupcake recipes. To make the recipe section
                    more engaging and interactive, I incorporated JavaScript to allow users to watch a YouTube video for
                    instructions on how to prepare the cupcakes using the ingredients I provided.

                    been working on. The website is designed to provide an easy way for users to browse
                    through my projects and view examples of my work. The gallery includes images and brief
                    descriptions of each project.

                <h2>Movie Data</h2>
                <p class="content">For the movie data project, I developed a user interface using HTML and utilized data
                    from a provided JavaScript object. To make the data more accessible and interactive for users, I
                    created a checkbox that enables users to filter movies based on the year of their release. Through
                    this feature, users can easily browse and view movies based on their preferred timeline.
